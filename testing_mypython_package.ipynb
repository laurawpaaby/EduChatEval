By default, a general problem-solving mode is used: the student is prompted to act as a learner tackling an educational task of their own choosing, while the tutor is prompted to assist in solving it. Examples of prompts can be found here: `src/dialogue_generation/txt_llm_inputs/system_prompts.yaml`. In the function the `mode` is set to match the wanted system prompt in the file. \n",

      "\n",
      "**Topic**: Climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thesis Statement**: \"Effective policies addressing climate change should prioritize reducing carbon emissions while also investing in renewable energy sources to mitigate environmental damage and combat global warming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This thesis is specific, arguable, and clearly states the main points of your essay.\n",

      "[Tutor]: Great question! Here are some common mistakes to avoid:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Vague language** – Be specific.\n",
      "2. **Lack of evidence** – Always support claims.\n",
      "3. **No conclusion** – Summarize and restate thesis.\n",
      "4. **Plagiarism** – Always cite sources.\n",

      "[Tutor]: Good strategy! Here’s how to revise and edit:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Read aloud** – Helps catch errors.\n",
      "2. **Take a break** – Come back with fresh eyes.\n",
      "3. **Check for flow** – Ensure ideas connect smoothly.\n",
      "4. **Proofread** – Look for grammar and spelling errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good luck!\n",

      "[Student]: Got it! One last question: How do I know if my essay is clear and well-structured?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Great question! Here’s how to check:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Read it back** – Ensure it flows logically.\n",
      "2. **Ask someone else** – Get a peer’s feedback.\n",
      "3. **Check thesis** – Is it clear and strong?\n",
      "4. **Look for cohesion** – Ideas connect and support thesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practice makes perfect!\n",
      "\n",

      "[Student]: Sure, let's start with the introduction. Could you give me an example of an essay topic so I can practice writing a good introduction?\n",

      "\n",
      "Good intro starts strong. Try this outline:\n",
      "1. Grab attention with a surprising fact or question.\n",
      "2. Briefly mention the topic.\n",
      "3. State your thesis clearly.\n",

      "[Student]: Great! Thanks for the examples. One more thing—how can I make sure my body paragraphs support my thesis effectively?\n",

      "1. Repeat key words subtly.  \n",
      "2. Transition smoothly between paragraphs.  \n",

      "--- Starting Dialogue Simulation ---\n",
      "\n",
      "[Student]: Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! The passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action rather than the doer. It's formed with \"to be\" + past participle. Example: \"The cake was eaten\" (focus on the cake, not who ate it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! To clarify, in the sentence \"The cake was eaten,\" the subject is the cake, and we don't know who ate it. Can you give me another example using different verbs?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Absolutely! Try: \"The letter was written yesterday.\" Subject: the letter; verb: was written.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you! Can you give me an example where the doer of the action is included?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! \"The cake was eaten by the children.\" Here, \"the children\" is the doer of the action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! And when would I use the passive voice more frequently?\n",
      "[Tutor]: You use passive voice when the doer is unimportant, unknown, or obvious. Examples: \"The meeting was delayed.\" \"The book was written by J.K. Rowling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! What if I want to emphasize the doer in a sentence? How would I do that?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Use active voice to emphasize the doer. Example: \"John wrote the book.\" If passive, it would be: \"The book was written by John.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you! One last question: Is there a difference in usage between formal and informal writing?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Yes! Passive voice is more common in formal writing to maintain objectivity. In informal writing, active voice is usually preferred for clarity and directness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 7:\n",
      "[Student]: Perfect, thanks! One last thing: Is there a specific rule for when to use the passive voice?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Use passive when the action is important and the doer is unimportant or unknown. Avoid it if the doer is important or known.\n",

      "Turn 8:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! Thanks for the clarification. Can you give me one more example in a real-world context?\n",

      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",

      "[Student]: Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! In English, the passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action or the result, not the doer. It's formed with \"to be\" + past participle. Example: \"The cake was eaten\" (not saying who ate it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! Can you give me an example of when I might use the passive voice in a sentence?\n",

      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Great example! What about the difference in active vs. passive voice?\n",
      "[Tutor]: In \"The dog chased the cat,\" \"The dog\" is the subject doing the action. In passive: \"The cat was chased by the dog.\" The focus shifts from doer to receiver of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! When should I use the passive voice in my writing?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Use passive when the action, not the doer, is important. E.g., \"Mistakes were avoided\" focuses on the result, not who avoided them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. And can you give me another example to practice?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Active: \"She baked a cake.\" Passive: \"A cake was baked by her.\"\n",

      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! What if I want to emphasize the doer in my sentence? Should I use active voice?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Yes, use active when you want to emphasize the doer. Like \"John wrote the report\" emphasizes John.\n",

      "[Student]: Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?\n",
      "[Tutor]: The passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action or the object. It changes the subject and verb order. For example, \"The book was read by her\" instead of \"She read the book.\" To form it, use \"be + past participle.\" Check if this helps!\n",

Every evening, she would sit on her porch, watching the sun dip below the horizon. Today, however, was different. A mysterious figure had been spotted near the old mill, and the town was buzzing with rumors of strange occurrences. \n",

      "[Tutor]: The passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action rather than the doer. It's formed with \"to be\" + past participle. E.g., \"The cake was eaten\" emphasizes the action of eating rather than who ate it.\n",

      "[Student]: Thanks! One last question: Can you give me an example where the passive voice is used in everyday conversation?\n",

      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Could you please explain more about the cell wall and its function?\n",
      "[Tutor]: The cell wall is a rigid outer layer made of cellulose. Its main functions are:\n",

      "1. Providing structural support\n",
      "2. Protection\n",
      "3. Maintaining cell shape\n",

      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Could you give me an example of how the cell wall helps maintain cell shape?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! The cell wall helps maintain cell shape by providing rigid support. \n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a plant cell like a balloon filled with water. Without the balloon (cell wall), it might stretch or change shape easily. The cell wall acts like the balloon, giving the cell structure and shape, especially important for standing plants.\n",

      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! Can you give me an example of a plant cell without a cell wall?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Most animal cells don't have cell walls. For example, a red blood cell in animals lacks a cell wall and relies on its membrane for structure.\n",

      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you! That makes sense. Can you give me another example of a plant cell with a cell wall?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Of course! Almost all plant cells have cell walls, like in a leaf cell or root cell. Even specialized cells like sieve tube elements have cell walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. Can you explain more about sieve tube elements and their cell walls?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Sieve tube elements are part of the plant's vascular system. Their cell walls have small openings called sieve pores. \n",
      "\n",
      "The sieve pores let nutrients and water move between cells, helping transport food throughout the plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 7:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! That’s helpful. Could you explain how sieve pores help with nutrient transport in the plant?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Of course! Sieve pores allow liquids to move freely between sieve tube elements and adjacent cells. This helps transport sugars and other nutrients from the leaves (where they're made) to other parts of the plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 8:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. Can you give me an example of how this nutrient transport works in a real plant?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! In a leaf, photosynthesis makes sugars. Sieve tube elements in the leaf transport these sugars to roots or developing fruits. Sieve pores let these sugars flow through the plant efficiently.\n",

      "[Student]: Hi, How does natural selection work in evolution?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Natural selection works by favoring traits that improve survival and reproduction. Variations occur in a population, and those better adapted survive and reproduce more, passing advantageous traits to offspring. This leads to gradual evolutionary changes over generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. To clarify, does natural selection mean only the strongest or fastest individuals survive and reproduce?\n",
      "[Tutor]: No, natural selection is broader. It favors traits that improve survival and reproduction in specific environmental conditions. Traits like speed, strength, or camouflage are advantageous in certain contexts but not all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Can you give me an example of how natural selection works in a specific environment?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! In industrial England during the Industrial Revolution, coal smoke darkened the environment. Birds with darker feathers had a survival advantage because they camouflaged better against predators. Over time, darker feathered birds reproduced more, passing on darker feather traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks for the example. Can you explain how mutations play a role in natural selection?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Mutations create genetic variations within a population. Natural selection then acts on these variations, favoring traits that enhance survival and reproduction. Mutations are the raw material for evolution, providing the diversity that natural selection works with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. So mutations are random changes in DNA, right? How do they become favorable for natural selection?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Yes, mutations introduce random changes in DNA. Some become favorable if they offer an advantage, like better camouflage or increased resistance to disease, allowing organisms with these traits to survive and reproduce more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! One last thing, how do environmental changes affect natural selection?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Environmental changes create new selective pressures. If conditions change, traits that were once disadvantageous might now be beneficial. This shifts what traits are favored, driving evolution in new directions.\n",

      "**Title:** Investigating Photosynthesis in Elodea\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction:** Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This lab examines oxygen production as a measure of photosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Method:**\n",
      "1. Place Elodea in a beaker with water.\n",
      "2. Shine light on the Elodea using a light source.\n",
      "3. Cover part of the plant to block light from one side.\n",
      "4. Measure oxygen production over time using a water displacement method.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Results:** Increased oxygen production was observed where light was not blocked, indicating active photosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** Photosynthesis occurs in the presence of light, and Elodea produces oxygen as part of this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would this help clarify the structure?\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks for the example. Could you please explain how measuring oxygen production is used as a measure of photosynthesis?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Oxygen production during photosynthesis is used because the light-dependent reactions produce oxygen as a byproduct. Measuring increased oxygen levels shows more photosynthesis is happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. Could you clarify how exactly we measure the oxygen production in this lab?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! In this lab, you could use a water displacement method. Drop small air bubbles into the water where the Elodea is. Measure and record the volume of water displaced by the bubbles over time. Increased displacement suggests more oxygen being produced through photosynthesis.\n",

      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! One last question: How do we control for variables like water temperature and light intensity to ensure accurate results?\n",

      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Got that. Is there anything specific about RNA's role in gene expression I should know?\n",
      "[Tutor]: RNA carries genetic info from DNA to make proteins. Specific types like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA have distinct roles in translation.\n",

      "**Context: Describing someone's routine before an event.**\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Cada mañana, él tomaba café antes de ir al trabajo.\" (Every morning, he would take coffee before going to work.)\n",
      "  - Here, \"tomaba\" (used Pretérito Imperfecto) shows this was a repeated action.\n",

      "1. **Pretérito Perfecto (había + past participle):**\n",
      "   - Used for completed actions in the past.\n",
      "   - Example: Había terminado el trabajo. (I had finished the work.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pretérito Imperfecto (estaba + past participle):**\n",
      "   - Used for ongoing or habitual actions in the past.\n",
      "   - Example: Estaba leyendo un libro. (I was reading a book.)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Context-driven:**\n",
      "   - **Pretérito Imperfecto:** Used for repeated actions or habits.\n",
      "     - Example: Cada mañana, él tomaba café. (Every morning, he would take coffee.)\n",
      "   - **Pretérito Perfecto:** Used for completed actions in the past.\n",
      "     - Example: Un día, él había tomado café. (One day, he had taken coffee.)\n",
      "\n",
      "This should help you choose the right tense based on context!\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 7:\n",
      "[Student]: That's really helpful. Thank you! One last thing, could you provide a quick example where the context is ambiguous and I need to decide which tense to use?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Absolutely! Here's an ambiguous example:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Context:**\n",
      "- \"Ella llegó tarde porque estuvo trabajando.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Choices:**\n",
      "1. \"Estuvo\" = Pretérito Imperfecto (ongoing)\n",
      "2. \"Había\" = Pretérito Perfecto (completed)\n",
      "\n",
      "Both are possible, but:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Ella estuvo trabajando porque llegó tarde.\" (She was working because she arrived late.)\n",
      "- \"Ella había trabajado porque llegó tarde.\" (She had worked because she arrived late.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The context determines the best choice!\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 8:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you! So in this case, \"estuvo\" would suggest she was still working when she arrived late, while \"había\" would indicate she had finished working before arriving. Got it!\n",
      "[Tutor]: Exactly! Great summary! \n",
      "- \"Estuvo\" shows she was still working when she arrived.\n",
      "- \"Había\" indicates she had finished working before arriving.\n",

      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you. Could you also suggest an app for improving Spanish pronunciation?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Certainly! Try \"Duolingo\" or \"HelloTalk\" for pronunciation practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. Could you explain more about how \"HelloTalk\" helps with pronunciation?\n",
      "[Tutor]: \"HelloTalk\" lets you practice with native speakers through messages and voice notes. It helps hear and mimic natural pronunciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. One last question: How can reading aloud help with Spanish pronunciation?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Reading aloud helps you get comfortable with word flows and improves your accent. It enhances recognition and recall of sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you! One more thing—do you have any tips for remembering the sounds of less common letters or combinations?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Practice words containing these letters. Write them down. Use flashcards. Listen to songs with those sounds.\n",

      "Turn 7:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. Could you recommend some Spanish songs with unique sounds that I could listen to?\n",

      "[Student]: Great! And what about saying someone is tired all the time versus just now?\n",

      "[Student]: Got it! One last clarification: Is there ever a case where both verbs could be used interchangeably?\n",

      "[Student]: Thanks! That makes sense. Can you give me a quick example where using the wrong verb would be confusing?\n",
