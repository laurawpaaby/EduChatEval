    "This notebook demonstrates the full pipeline implemented in the package, illustrating a potential use case in the absence of real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A synthetic framework (i.e., an annotated dataset) is first generated.\n",
    "2. A BERT classifier is then trained on the synthesized data. \n",
    "3. Next, an interaction is simulated between two agents representing a 'student' and a 'tutor'.\n",
    "4. The trained classifier is then applied to the simulated conversation. In this case, both agents' outputs are analyzed.\n",
    "5. Finally, the classified data is presented in a descriptive format, showcasing how results might be reported in a real-world scenario."

      "[Student]: Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! The passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action rather than the doer. It's formed with \"to be\" + past participle. Example: \"The cake was eaten\" (focus on the cake, not who ate it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",

      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you! Can you give me an example where the doer of the action is included?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! \"The cake was eaten by the children.\" Here, \"the children\" is the doer of the action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! And when would I use the passive voice more frequently?\n",
      "[Tutor]: You use passive voice when the doer is unimportant, unknown, or obvious. Examples: \"The meeting was delayed.\" \"The book was written by J.K. Rowling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! What if I want to emphasize the doer in a sentence? How would I do that?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Use active voice to emphasize the doer. Example: \"John wrote the book.\" If passive, it would be: \"The book was written by John.\"\n",

      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you! One last question: Is there a difference in usage between formal and informal writing?\n",

      "[Student]: Perfect, thanks! One last thing: Is there a specific rule for when to use the passive voice?\n",

      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Sure, let's start with the introduction. How should I begin an essay?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Start with a hook to grab attention, followed by background info, and end with your thesis. Example: \"Hashtags dominate social media. While they enhance communication, excessive use can diminish personal expression.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. What makes a good hook for my essay?\n",
      "[Tutor]: A strong hook is engaging and relevant. Try a quote, fact, question, or surprising statement. E.g., \"Did you know 80% of social media posts use hashtags?\"\n",

      "[Student]: Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! In English, the passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action or the result, not the doer. It's formed with \"to be\" + past participle. Example: \"The cake was eaten\" (not saying who ate it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! Can you give me an example of when I might use the passive voice in a sentence?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Use it when the doer is unknown or unimportant: \"The letter was written yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Great example! What about the difference in active vs. passive voice?\n",
      "[Tutor]: In \"The dog chased the cat,\" \"The dog\" is the subject doing the action. In passive: \"The cat was chased by the dog.\" The focus shifts from doer to receiver of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! When should I use the passive voice in my writing?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Use passive when the action, not the doer, is important. E.g., \"Mistakes were avoided\" focuses on the result, not who avoided them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. And can you give me another example to practice?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Active: \"She baked a cake.\" Passive: \"A cake was baked by her.\"\n",

      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! What if I want to emphasize the doer in my sentence? Should I use active voice?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Yes, use active when you want to emphasize the doer. Like \"John wrote the report\" emphasizes John.\n",

      "\n",
      "Turn 7:\n",
      "[Student]: The school hallway is significant because it represents the environment where Samantha must face her exam on time. The tension is heightened by the countdown and pressure to arrive on time. How does this add to the overall tension of the story?\n",

      "[Student]: Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?\n",
      "[Tutor]: The passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action rather than the doer. It's formed with \"to be\" + past participle. E.g., \"The cake was eaten\" emphasizes the action of eating rather than who ate it.\n",
      "\n",

      "[Student]: Could you give me an example of when we would use the passive voice to emphasize the action?\n",

      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. And what about when we want to be more formal or objective? When should we use the passive voice?\n",

      "[Student]: Thanks! One last question: Can you give me an example where the passive voice is used in everyday conversation?\n",

      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Could you explain how beneficial traits are passed on during reproduction?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Organisms with beneficial traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. When they reproduce, they pass these beneficial traits to their offspring through genes. Over generations, this leads to increased prevalence of those traits in the population.\n",

      "The sieve pores let nutrients and water move between cells, helping transport food throughout the plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 7:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! That’s helpful. Could you explain how sieve pores help with nutrient transport in the plant?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Of course! Sieve pores allow liquids to move freely between sieve tube elements and adjacent cells. This helps transport sugars and other nutrients from the leaves (where they're made) to other parts of the plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 8:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. Can you give me an example of how this nutrient transport works in a real plant?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! In a leaf, photosynthesis makes sugars. Sieve tube elements in the leaf transport these sugars to roots or developing fruits. Sieve pores let these sugars flow through the plant efficiently.\n",

      "[Student]: Hi, How does natural selection work in evolution?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Natural selection works by favoring traits that improve survival and reproduction. Variations occur in a population, and those better adapted survive and reproduce more, passing advantageous traits to offspring. This leads to gradual evolutionary changes over generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. To clarify, does natural selection mean only the strongest or fastest individuals survive and reproduce?\n",
      "[Tutor]: No, natural selection is broader. It favors traits that improve survival and reproduction in specific environmental conditions. Traits like speed, strength, or camouflage are advantageous in certain contexts but not all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Can you give me an example of how natural selection works in a specific environment?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! In industrial England during the Industrial Revolution, coal smoke darkened the environment. Birds with darker feathers had a survival advantage because they camouflaged better against predators. Over time, darker feathered birds reproduced more, passing on darker feather traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks for the example. Can you explain how mutations play a role in natural selection?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Mutations create genetic variations within a population. Natural selection then acts on these variations, favoring traits that enhance survival and reproduction. Mutations are the raw material for evolution, providing the diversity that natural selection works with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. So mutations are random changes in DNA, right? How do they become favorable for natural selection?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Yes, mutations introduce random changes in DNA. Some become favorable if they offer an advantage, like better camouflage or increased resistance to disease, allowing organisms with these traits to survive and reproduce more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! One last thing, how do environmental changes affect natural selection?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Environmental changes create new selective pressures. If conditions change, traits that were once disadvantageous might now be beneficial. This shifts what traits are favored, driving evolution in new directions.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Title:** Investigating Photosynthesis in Elodea\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction:** Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This lab examines oxygen production as a measure of photosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Method:**\n",
      "1. Place Elodea in a beaker with water.\n",
      "2. Shine light on the Elodea using a light source.\n",
      "3. Cover part of the plant to block light from one side.\n",
      "4. Measure oxygen production over time using a water displacement method.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Results:** Increased oxygen production was observed where light was not blocked, indicating active photosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** Photosynthesis occurs in the presence of light, and Elodea produces oxygen as part of this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would this help clarify the structure?\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks for the example. Could you please explain how measuring oxygen production is used as a measure of photosynthesis?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Oxygen production during photosynthesis is used because the light-dependent reactions produce oxygen as a byproduct. Measuring increased oxygen levels shows more photosynthesis is happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. Could you clarify how exactly we measure the oxygen production in this lab?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! In this lab, you could use a water displacement method. Drop small air bubbles into the water where the Elodea is. Measure and record the volume of water displaced by the bubbles over time. Increased displacement suggests more oxygen being produced through photosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! One last question: How do we control for variables like water temperature and light intensity to ensure accurate results?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Good question! Control variables by keeping water temperature constant using a heater or cooler, and use a controlled light source like a grow lamp with consistent intensity. Repeat experiments if needed for accuracy.\n",

      "[Student]: Hi, What’s the difference between DNA and RNA?\n",
      "[Tutor]: DNA is double-stranded and stores genetic info. RNA is single-stranded and helps express genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! To clarify, is RNA involved directly in storing genetic information, or is that solely DNA's role?\n",
      "[Tutor]: DNA stores genetic info. RNA helps express genes but doesn't store info directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Got that. Is there anything specific about RNA's role in gene expression I should know?\n",
      "[Tutor]: RNA carries genetic info from DNA to make proteins. Specific types like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA have distinct roles in translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! Can you give me an example of how mRNA helps in translating genetic information into proteins?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! mRNA carries DNA's instructions to ribosomes. Ribosomes use these instructions to assemble amino acids into proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: That makes sense. Are there any other types of RNA besides mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Yes, there are others like miRNA for gene regulation and snoRNA for RNA processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Great! Can you give me a brief example of how miRNA works for gene regulation?\n",
      "[Tutor]: MiRNA binds to mRNA and can inhibit translation or degrade it, controlling gene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 7:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! So RNA and DNA both carry genetic information, but RNA is more involved in the actual process of making proteins.\n",

      "[Student]: Thanks! Can you explain what \"levanté\" means in this sentence?\n",

      "1. **Pretérito Perfecto (había + past participle)**: For completed actions in the past.\n",
      "   - Example: Había terminado el trabajo. (I had finished the work.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pretérito Imperfecto (estaba + past participle)**: For ongoing or habitual actions in the past.\n",
      "   - Example: Estaba leyendo un libro. (I was reading a book.)\n",

      "- \"Ella estaba llegando a las 8.\" (She was arriving at 8.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The first sentence implies she arrived before the event started, while the second suggests she was still arriving at 8. Context helps choose the right tense!\n",

      "\n",
      "- \"Cada mañana, él tomaba café antes de ir al trabajo.\" (Every morning, he would take coffee before going to work.)\n",
      "  - Here, \"tomaba\" (used Pretérito Imperfecto) shows this was a repeated action.\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Un día, él había tomado café antes de ir al trabajo.\" (One day, he had taken coffee before going to work.)\n",
      "  - Here, \"había tomado\" (used Pretérito Perfecto) suggests it was a completed action.\n",

      "   - Example: Estaba leyendo un libro. (I was reading a book.)\n",

      "3. **Context-driven:**\n",
      "   - **Pretérito Imperfecto:** Used for repeated actions or habits.\n",

      "   - **Pretérito Perfecto:** Used for completed actions in the past.\n",
      "     - Example: Un día, él había tomado café. (One day, he had taken coffee.)\n",

      "[Student]: Great, so I should say: \n",
      "**Person A:** ¿Qué hora es?\n",
      "**Person B:** Son las tres.\n",
      "[Tutor]: Exactly! Give it a try:  \n",
      "**Person A:** ¿Qué hora es?  \n",
      "**Person B:** Son las tres.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Great practice!\n",

      "**Person B:** Son las tres.  \n",
      "\n",
      "How does that sound?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Great job! You're doing well. Keep practicing, and it will sound more natural over time. How does it feel when you say it?\n",

      "[Student]: Hi, what are some tips for improving Spanish pronunciation?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Practice vowel sounds daily. Listen to native speakers and mimic them. Use apps for pronunciation. Read aloud to get comfortable with sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: I'm not sure I fully understand. Could you provide examples of Spanish vowel sounds that are tricky for non-native speakers?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Try these:\n",
      "- \"U\" as in \"puro\" (sounds like \"o\" in \"book\")\n",
      "- \"I\" as in \"fiesta\" (sounds like \"ee\" in \"see\")\n",
      "- \"A\" in some positions sounds like \"ah\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you. Could you also suggest an app for improving Spanish pronunciation?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Certainly! Try \"Duolingo\" or \"HelloTalk\" for pronunciation practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. Could you explain more about how \"HelloTalk\" helps with pronunciation?\n",
      "[Tutor]: \"HelloTalk\" lets you practice with native speakers through messages and voice notes. It helps hear and mimic natural pronunciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. One last question: How can reading aloud help with Spanish pronunciation?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Reading aloud helps you get comfortable with word flows and improves your accent. It enhances recognition and recall of sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you! One more thing—do you have any tips for remembering the sounds of less common letters or combinations?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Practice words containing these letters. Write them down. Use flashcards. Listen to songs with those sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 7:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. Could you recommend some Spanish songs with unique sounds that I could listen to?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Try \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi, \"La Bamba\" by Ritchie Valens, or \"Macarena.\" Listen to the lyrics to focus on unique sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 8:\n",
      "[Student]: Thank you! One last question—how can listening to Spanish podcasts help with pronunciation?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Listening to podcasts exposes you to natural speech. Repeat after the hosts. Write down words you hear. Focus on pronunciation.\n",

      "[Student]: Hi, can you explain when to use 'ser' vs 'estar' in Spanish?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Use \"ser\" for permanent states, characteristics, and identities. Use \"estar\" for temporary states, locations, and conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it. To summarize, would it be correct to say \"ser feliz\" for permanent happiness and \"estar enfermo\" for being sick right now?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Yes, exactly! \"Ser feliz\" for permanent happiness and \"estar enfermo\" for being sick right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! Could you give me an example of when to use \"estar\" for location?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Use \"estar\" for temporary locations: \"Estoy en la casa\" (I am at the house).\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4:\n",
      "[Student]: Great! And what about saying someone is tired all the time versus just now?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Good question! For being tired all the time: \"Estoy siempre cansado\" (I am always tired). For just now: \"Estoy cansado\" (I am tired right now).\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! One last clarification: Is there ever a case where both verbs could be used interchangeably?\n",
      "[Tutor]: No, not really. \"Ser\" and \"estar\" generally aren’t interchangeable. They indicate different types of states or conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 6:\n",
      "[Student]: Thanks! That makes sense. Can you give me a quick example where using the wrong verb would be confusing?\n",
      "[Tutor]: Sure! Saying \"Estoy enfermo\" is correct for being sick right now. But if you said \"Ser enfermo,\" it would mean having a sickness condition, which is not natural in Spanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 7:\n",
      "[Student]: Got it! Thanks for the examples. One last question: Can you give me a quick rule of thumb for remembering when to use \"estar\" or \"ser\"?\n",

      "\n",
      "Turn 8:\n",
      "[Student]: Perfect! Thanks for the clear rule. That should help me remember.\n",

As demonstrated below, only a few lines of code are required to launch an interactive session with a prompted agent.

This functionality relies on a LM Studio-hosted model and server like the framework generator in Step 1.1.\n",
