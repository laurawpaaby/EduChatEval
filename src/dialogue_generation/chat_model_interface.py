    Abstract base class that defines the required interface for any chat model
    used within the chatbot interaction system.

    Implementing classes must provide:
    - A `load()` method to initialize the model and tokenizer resources.
    - A `generate()` method that accepts a list of ChatMessage objects as
      conversational context and returns a ChatMessage containing the assistant's response.

    This interface ensures that agents can interact with any underlying model
    implementation (e.g., Hugging Face, MLX) in a consistent way.
