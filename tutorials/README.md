## Tutorials for EduChatEval üß≠
This folder contains two Jupyter notebooks and a set of instructions to support users of the EduChatEval package. Each tutorial walks through a distinct scenario using fully synthetic data, no real user data is involved.

The [`feedback_demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/tree/main/tutorials/feedback_demo.ipynb) demonstrates how to analyze the types of feedback a chatbot provides to a student. In contrast, the [`intention_demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/tree/main/tutorials/intentions_demo.ipynb) focuses on identifying the underlying intentions behind messages exchanged between the student and the chatbot.

Each tutorial highlights different aspects of the package:
- [`feedback_demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/tree/main/tutorials/feedback_demo.ipynb) illustrates a basic application scenario.
- [`intention_demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/tree/main/tutorials/intentions_demo.ipynb) shows a more advanced use case, demonstrating the full range of available functions and customization options.

The [`chat_wrap_instructions.md`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/blob/main/tutorials/chat_wrap_instructions.md) provides step-by-step guidance for launching a terminal-based chat interface üñ•Ô∏è that enables students to interact with a configurable LLM. All interactions are automatically logged for later analysis.
