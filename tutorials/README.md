## Tutorials for EduChatEval
This folder contains two tutorials and a set of instructions to support users of the EduChatEval package. Both tutorials walk through distinct example scenarios using fully synthetic data—no real user data is included.

The [`feedback_demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/tree/main/tutorials/feedback_demo.ipynb) demonstrates how to analyze the types of feedback a chatbot provides to a student. In contrast, the [`intention_demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/tree/main/tutorials/intentions_demo.ipynb) focuses on identifying the underlying intentions behind messages exchanged between the student and the chatbot. Each tutorial showcases different aspects of the package. The [`feedback_demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/tree/main/tutorials/feedback_demo.ipynb) illustrates a basic use case, while [`intention_demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/tree/main/tutorials/intentions_demo.ipynb) demonstrates a more advanced application, including the full range of available functions and customization options.

Finally, [`chat_wrap_instructions.md`](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/blob/main/tutorials/chat_wrap_instructions.md) provides step-by-step guidance for launching a terminal-based chat interface that allows students to interact with a chatbot. These interactions are automatically logged, and the underlying LLM can be configured according to the researcher’s choice.
