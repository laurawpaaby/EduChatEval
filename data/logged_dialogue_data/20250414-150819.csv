1,Hi can you help me with my geography homework,"What specifically do you need help with (e.g. mapping, country data, geography concepts)?"
2,I need to know the five largest capitals,"The 5 largest capitals in the world by population are:

1. Tokyo, Japan (approx. 38 million)
2. Delhi, India (approx. 29 million)
3. Beijing, China (approx. 21 million)
4. Mexico City, Mexico (approx. 21 million)
5. Cairo, Egypt (approx. 20 million)"
3,i need to know the biggest river in the world,"The Nile River is considered the longest and largest river in the world, with a total length of approximately 6,695 kilometers (4,160 miles). It flows through 11 countries and is a vital source of water for millions of people."
4,what is the smallest mountain?,"Mount Marum, located in Vanuatu, is often referred to as the smallest mountain in the world. It stands at a height of approximately 45 meters (148 feet) above sea level and was previously recognized as the world's shortest mountain, but its height has been disputed."
5,can you please explain to me the types of mountains?,"There are several types of mountains, classified based on their height and formation:

1. **Hills**: Low-lying areas with gentle slopes, typically below 300 meters (1000 feet) high.
2. **Mountains**: Tall, steep peaks that exceed 300 meters (1000 feet) high.
3. **Volcanic mountains**: Formed by volcanic eruptions, these mountains can be found on land and underwater.
4. **Fold mountains**: Formed by the movement of tectonic plates, these mountains have a complex structure and often have peaks above 3000 meters (10,000 feet) high.
5. **Plateau mountains**: Flat-topped mountains with steep slopes on either side.

Additionally, there are several subcategories of mountains, including:

* **Dolomites**: High, narrow peaks with steep sides.
* **Alps**: Fold mountains formed by tectonic plate movement.
* **Towers and peaks**: Individual, isolated mountain peaks.

Each type of mountain has its own unique characteristics, formed through different geological processes."
6,"thank you, now what is the smallest flower?","The smallest flower in the world is thought to be **West Indian flower** (Mimosa pudica), but a more specific answer is the **Dwarf Violet** (Viola thysbe). It has small, delicate petals and a total height of around 1-2 centimeters (0.4-0.8 inches)."
