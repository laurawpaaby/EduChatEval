Given: Solve for x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20.

My solution:
1. Subtract 5 from both sides: 3x = 15
2. Divide both sides by 3: x = 5

My explanation: To solve the equation, I first eliminated the constant on the left side by subtracting 5 from both sides. Then, I divided both sides by the coefficient of x to isolate x, resulting in x = 5.","Your solution is clear and correct! Here’s a suggestion to enhance your explanation:

After subtracting 5 from both sides, you could explicitly state that you are doing this to isolate the variable term on one side of the equation. This helps clarify the purpose of each step.

Revised explanation:
1. Subtract 5 from both sides: 3x = 15. **(Reason: This isolates the variable term on one side.)**
2. Divide both sides by 3: x = 5. **(Reason: This isolates x, solving for the variable.)**

Feel free to incorporate this reasoning into your explanation!",evaluative_feedback_student_3,evaluative_feedback

2. Divide both sides by 3: x = 5. **(Reason: This isolates x, solving for the variable.)**

My explanation:
By subtracting 5 from both sides, the equation now only contains terms with the variable, simplifying it further. Dividing both sides by 3 allows us to solve for x directly.

Would you say this is clearer now?","Absolutely! Your revised explanation is clear and well-structured. Here’s a minor suggestion to enhance it even more:

After your second step, you could add: ""Thus, x = 5 is the solution to the equation.""
