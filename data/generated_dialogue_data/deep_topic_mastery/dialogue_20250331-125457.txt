[User] I really want to understand English verb tenses deeply. Can we go through them one by one, and I’ll ask for examples and clarifications as we go?
[Assistant] Absolutely! Let's start with the simplest and most common: **Present Simple**. 

The **Present Simple** is used for actions that are habitual, regular, or true at the present time. For example:

- He walks to work.
- They play tennis every Saturday.

Do you want to go over some examples or do you need clarification on this?
[User] Great, let's go deeper with the **Present Simple**. Could you please provide more examples of habitual actions and explain when we use "do" before the verb in questions and negative sentences? Also, could you give an example where we don't use "do"?
[Assistant] Sure! Let's dive deeper into the **Present Simple**.

### Habits and Regular Actions
The **Present Simple** is used for actions that happen regularly or as a habit. It’s often used in the third person singular (he, she, it) where you add "-s" or "-es" to the verb. For example:

- He **works** in a bank. (habitual action)
- She **reads** newspapers every morning. (habitual action)
- It **rains** a lot in London. (habitual weather pattern)

### Questions and Negatives
In questions and negative sentences, we use **do** to form the auxiliary verb. Here’s how it works:

- **Question Form**: "Do + subject + verb?"
  - Example: **Do** he **work** in a bank?
  
- **Negative Form**: "Subject + do + not + verb + anything else"
  - Example: He **doesn't** work in a bank.

**Do Not Use "Do"**:
You do **not** use "do" in the following:
- In statements: "He works in a bank." 
- In yes/no questions: "Does he work in a bank?"
- In negative sentences: "He doesn't work in a bank."

### Example Without "Do":
- Statement: "She reads books every day." (No "do" here)
- Question: "Does she read books every day?" (Uses "do" in this form)
- Negative: "She doesn't read books every day." (Uses "do" to form the negative)

Does this help? Do you want to try some examples or go over another tense?
[User] That's helpful! Let's try some examples to solidify my understanding.

1. For habits or regular actions:
   - **Positive**: He **likes** playing football. 
   - **Question**: **Does** he **like** playing football? 
   - **Negative**: He **doesn't like** playing football.

2. For questions:
   - **Does** she **go** to the gym regularly? 

3. For negatives:
   - **She** **doesn't go** to the gym regularly.

### When to Use the Present Simple in Third Person Singular:
The **Present Simple** is used for third-person singular subjects (he, she, it) when referring to habitual, regular, or general truths. Here are some tips:
- Use the **-s** or **-es** ending for third-person singular: He **reads**, she **goes**, it **grows**.
- Don't add **-s** or **-es** for non-singular subjects: We **read**, they **go**, they **write**.
