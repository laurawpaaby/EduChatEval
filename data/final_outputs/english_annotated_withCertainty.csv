2,"Sure, let's start with the introduction. Could you give me an example of an essay topic so I can practice writing a good introduction?","Sure! How about this topic: ""The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health.""

1,"Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?","Sure! The passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action rather than the doer. It's formed with ""to be"" + past participle. Example: ""The cake was eaten"" (focus on the cake, not who ate it).",english_course_student_2,english_course,Clarification,0.99980026,Statement,0.99955255
2,"Got it! To clarify, in the sentence ""The cake was eaten,"" the subject is the cake, and we don't know who ate it. Can you give me another example using different verbs?","Absolutely!

""The book was written by J.K. Rowling.""",english_course_student_2,english_course,Small Talk,0.998437,Statement,0.99856097
5,Got it! What if I want to emphasize the doer in a sentence? How would I do that?,"Use active voice to emphasize the doer. Example: ""John wrote the book."" If passive, it would be: ""The book was written by John.""",english_course_student_2,english_course,Clarification,0.99978,Statement,0.85403085
6,Thank you! One last question: Is there a difference in usage between formal and informal writing?,"Yes! Passive voice is more common in formal writing to maintain objectivity. In informal writing, active voice is usually preferred for clarity and directness.",english_course_student_2,english_course,Question,0.48721382,Statement,0.99963355
7,"Perfect, thanks! One last thing: Is there a specific rule for when to use the passive voice?",Use passive when the action is important and the doer is unimportant or unknown.

Remember, when the subject is plural, the verb should also be plural.",english_course_student_3,english_course,Clarification,0.99983394,Clarification,0.9728617
3,Thank you. Could you provide another example involving commas?,"Of course! Here‚Äôs another example:

Incorrect: My friends and his sister are coming to visit.

Correct: My friends, and his sister, are coming to visit.

Or better: My friends, and his sister, are coming to visit. (Add a comma before and if there are more elements)

Commas help separate elements in a list or set off introductory phrases.",english_course_student_3,english_course,Clarification,0.999814,Clarification,0.9872377
4,"Great, thanks! Can you give me a quick example of misplaced modifiers?","Sure! Here‚Äôs a quick example:

5,Thanks! One last thing‚Äîwhat are homophones and can you give an example?,"Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings.

When he opened the creaky front door, a cold chill ran down his spine.""","Got it. Here are some key elements to analyze in these paragraphs:

1. **Setting**: The old mansion is the central setting, creating a sense of mystery and suspense.

Does that help frame your thoughts on the mood?",english_course_student_5,english_course,Clarification,0.9996835,Question,0.58723116
6,"Yes, that's helpful. Can you suggest how the setting of the stormy night contributes to John's decision to explore the mansion?","Great question! The stormy night:

1. Makes the mansion seem more mysterious and dangerous.
2. Lowers visibility, increasing the sense of mystery and danger.
3. Could be seen as encouraging John to explore, as the weather isolates him.

These factors likely contributed to John feeling bold enough to go.",english_course_student_5,english_course,Clarification,0.99973065,Small Talk,0.9720214
7,Thank you! Can you also help me think about what John might be thinking or feeling during this part of the story?,"Certainly! Here are some ideas:

- Excitement and curiosity about exploring the mansion.

4,Thanks! When should I use the passive voice in my writing?,"Use passive when the action, not the doer, is important. E.g., ""Mistakes were avoided"" focuses on the result, not who avoided them.",english_course_student_7,english_course,Small Talk,0.6173701,Statement,0.9765919

5,Thanks! Can you give me an example of how Tim's fear might evolve into curiosity again?,"Sure! When Tim first reads the diary, he might feel fear and shock at the secrets. But as he continues reading, he gets more involved and curious about the full story. For example, his initial fear could lead him to:

- Want to know why the secrets are hidden
- Feel drawn to uncover more of the past
- Realize there are more pages to read

This shift shows growing curiosity overcoming initial fear.",english_course_student_10,english_course,Clarification,0.9995733,Statement,0.98380184

3,"That's common! How about we try with a simple topic like ""The Benefits of Regular Exercise""? What do you think should be the main point of the thesis statement?","Good start!

4,"That sounds good! Now, how do you think we can expand on that thesis in the body paragraphs?","Great thesis! For body paragraphs, aim for:
1. Exercise boosts physical health (e.g., heart health, strength)
2. Enhances mental well-being (stress reduction, mood improvement)
3. Increases quality of life (energy, productivity, longevity)
Each point supports the main idea clearly.",english_course_student_11,english_course,Clarification,0.998865,Question,0.73407465

1,"Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?","The passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action or the object. It changes the subject and verb order. For example, ""The book was read by her"" instead of ""She read the book."" To form it, use ""be + past participle."" Check if this helps!",english_course_student_12,english_course,Clarification,0.99980026,Clarification,0.53498966
2,"Sure, to clarify further, could you give me an example of when I might use the passive voice in everyday conversation?","Sure! You might say, ""The window was broken last night.""

3,Thanks. Can you give me another example where the passive voice would be useful?,"Of course! Like, ""Coffee is served in the lounge."" This emphasizes that coffee is available there, not who serves it.",english_course_student_12,english_course,Clarification,0.99980825,Statement,0.9877528
4,Got it. And when should I use the active voice instead of the passive?,"Use active voice for clarity and directness, like ""She baked the cake.""

5,Thanks! Can you give me a quick example where the active voice would be more appropriate?,"Sure! For example, ""John wrote the book"" is more direct and clear than ""The book was written by John.""",english_course_student_12,english_course,Clarification,0.9997955,Question,0.87638754

4,Great! Thanks for the examples. Could you also explain when to use a comma in a list?,"Sure! Use commas between items in a list:

1,"Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?","The passive voice in English is used when you want to emphasize the action or the object. It hides the doer of the action.

Every evening, she would sit on her porch, watching the sun dip below the horizon. Today, however, was different. A mysterious figure had been spotted near the old mill, and the town was buzzing with rumors of strange occurrences. 

Let's start with the atmosphere. How would you describe it?","The atmosphere is mysterious and eerie, setting a suspenseful tone.

1,"Hi, Can you explain how to use the passive voice in English?","The passive voice is used when you want to emphasize the action rather than the doer. It's formed with ""to be"" + past participle.

5,Got it. And what about when we want to be more formal or objective? When should we use the passive voice?,"Use passive for formal, objective writing. Like: ""Errors were identified in the report.""

6,Thanks! One last question: Can you give me an example where the passive voice is used in everyday conversation?,"Sure! ""Was the meeting rescheduled?"" This avoids saying who rescheduled it, keeping it casual.",english_course_student_22,english_course,Clarification,0.99972266,Small Talk,0.9862105
7,"Perfect, thanks! One more quick question: Is there any time when using the passive voice is incorrect or not preferred?","Yes, avoid passive when it's unclear who did the action or when it's more natural to name the doer.

6,"Got it! Thanks for the example. One more thing, could you clarify what a fragment is again?","Sure! A fragment:

What do you think about these ideas?",english_course_student_25,english_course,Clarification,0.9959929,Small Talk,0.6337533
5,That sounds good! Could you give me an example of how Eliza uses her wisdom to help others in the story?,"Sure! If Eliza uses her wisdom to solve a village problem, like curing an illness or resolving a dispute, that would show how her knowledge benefits the community.

Example: ""Eliza heard the villagers talking about a sick child. She visited the family and, after some quiet contemplation, suggested a natural remedy she discovered from her many years. The child recovered.""

Does this help?",english_course_student_25,english_course,Clarification,0.9993067,Question,0.86453116
