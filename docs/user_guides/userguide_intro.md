This user guide presents two illustrative use cases that demonstrate the functionality and flexibility of the package, along with a set of prompt and seed templates tailored for different application settings. While no real-world data was available at the time of development, the examples are designed to showcase the pipeline's potential through simulated scenarios.

The first use case focuses on generating feedback using a tutor-agent, emphasizing the types of feedback produced by the tutor. The second example adopts a more traditional setup, involving both student and tutor roles within a simplified linguistic framework.

Detailed information on the available classes, functions, and configuration options can be found in the [API reference](https://laurawpaaby.github.io/EduChatEval/api/api_frame_gen/).
