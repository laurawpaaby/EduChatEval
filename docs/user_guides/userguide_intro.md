This user guide presents two illustrative use cases that demonstrate the functionality and flexibility of the package, along with a set of prompt and seed templates tailored for different application settings. While no real-world data was available at the time of development, the examples are designed to showcase the pipeline's potential through simulated scenarios.

The first use case focuses on generating feedback using a tutor-agent, emphasizing the types and structure of feedback produced. The second example adopts a more traditional setup, involving both student and tutor roles within a simplified linguistic framework. Together, these examples highlight the adaptability of the package and its applicability across a broad range of educational and conversational contexts.

Information on how to run these tests consult along with code examples can be found in the [API reference](https://laurawpaaby.github.io/EduChatEval/api/api_frame_gen/).
