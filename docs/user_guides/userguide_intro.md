This user guide presents two illustrative use cases that demonstrate the functionality and flexibility of the package, along with a set of prompt and seed templates tailored for different application settings. While no real-world data was available at the time of development, the examples are designed to showcase the pipeline's potential through simulated scenarios.

The first use case centers on *feedback* generation, analyzing the types of feedback produced by a tutor agent in response to diverse student tasks. The second scenario shifts focus to modeling message *intentions* in multi-turn dialogues between student and tutor agents.

Detailed information on the available classes, functions, and configuration options can be found in the [API reference](https://laurawpaaby.github.io/EduChatEval/api/api_frame_gen/).
