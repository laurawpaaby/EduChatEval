# About

### Project
This package was developed as part of a master’s thesis on the MSc in Cognitive Science at Aarhus University. With this package, I hope to contribute to the development of methods for evaluating the use of LLMs.

The main contribution is refining and wrapping existing methods into a coherent test suite. Additionally, we have introduced our own evaluation and visualization functions to present the results of various metrics in a cohesive manner.

### Contact
If you have any questions regarding the project or the code implementation, feel free to contact someone@example.com.
