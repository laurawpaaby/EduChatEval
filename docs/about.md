# About

### Project
This package was developed as part of a master's thesis in Cognitive Science at Aarhus University. The project explores how interactions between students and LLM-based tutors can be systematically analyzed using natural language processing, classification pipelines, and visualization techniques.

The core contribution is the enablement of quantitative evaluation of interaction-based learning by transforming student–tutor exchanges into structured, labeled data. Through classifier-based annotation and modular components for synthetic data generation, interaction simulation, and result visualization, the package enables a reproducible and data-driven approach to studying chatbot-assisted education. It is designed for flexibility across educational and experimental contexts, particularly where interaction analysis is needed beyond traditional self-report methods.
