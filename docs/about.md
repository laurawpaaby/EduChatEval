# About

### Project
This package was developed as part of a master’s thesis in Cognitive Science at Aarhus University. It provides a modular framework for systematically capturing and analyzing interactions between students and LLM-based chatbots in educational settings.

The core contribution is supporting quantitative, interaction-level evaluation by turning dialogue data into structured, labeled outputs. By combining tools for classification, simulation, and visualization, the package enables data-driven reproducible analysis of chatbot-assisted learning and is intended for use in both experimental and applied research contexts.


The full source code for the [`EduChatEval package`](https://pypi.org/project/educhateval/) is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/tree/main) and is licensed under [MIT License](https://github.com/laurawpaaby/EduChatEval/blob/main/LICENSE)
