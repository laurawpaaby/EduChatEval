This package provides an evaluation framework for analyzing interactions between students and LLM-based tutors through classification, simulation, and visualization tools.

The package is designed to:

- Provide a customized framework for classification, evaluation, and fine-tuning
- Simulate studentâ€“tutor interactions using role-based prompts and seed messages when real data is unavailable
- Initiate an interface with locally hosted, open-source models (e.g., via LM Studio or Hugging Face)
- Log interactions in structured formats (JSON/CSV) for downstream analysis
- Train and applu classifiers to predict customized interaction classes and visualize patterns across conversations
